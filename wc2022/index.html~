<h2> The rules: </h2>
<ul>
<li>
The basic idea is to buy "shares" in teams. Every time a team
wins a match, it gets a certain number of points.
These points are divided among the shareholders according to the
number of shares they own.</li>
<li>
You have <b>10 shares</b>, which you use to pick teams. 
You can choose how you 
spread them between the teams, but you can take 
<b>at most only 4 shares</b> in any one team.
The number of
shares per team is not fixed; the better teams will earn more points,
but those points are likely to be spread among more shares.
You must decide on your shares before the kick-off of the first match, and
it is not possible to change them after that.</li>
<li>
The number of points a team gets by winning a match depends on the stage of
the tournament 
<ul>
<li>  1 for the group stage matches (and 0.5 for a draw)</li>
<li>  1 for getting into to the playoff stage</li>
<li>  2 for the round of 16</li>
<li>  4 for the quarter finals</li>
<li>  8 for the semi finals</li>
<li>  4 for the third place</li>
<li>  16 for the final</li>
</ul>
<pre>
    the number of points you get= 
         (the number of points the team got) 
       * (the number of shares you own in the team)
       / (the total number of shares in the team)
</pre>
</li>
<li>
The winner is the player who has the most points after the tournament.
In case of a draw, the player who owns a bigger share in the winning team
wins (or if those are equal then the runner-up and so on.) 
</li>
<li>
No money will be involved: The winner's prize will be eternal glory.
In addition, the losers may feel a moral obligation to buy
the winner a beer or some alternative non-alcoholic drink should
an opportunity to this arise.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Participate:</h2>
Send your entry by e-mail to 
<a
href="mailto:a.rajantie@imperial.ac.uk">a.rajantie@imperial.ac.uk</a>
before the kickoff of the first
match of the tournament (19:00 Qatar time on Sunday 20 November 2022).
Use this exact format in your message:

</td></tr></table>

Here <tt>XXX</tt> are the three-letter country codes of the teams
you want to buy shares in. The list of the codes of the participating
countries can be found below.
You may repeat the same country code at most four
times, 
and there have to be in total 10 of them. Please make sure that you follow
these rules, because otherwise you may be excluded from the competition.
<br>
Please note that these official FIFA country codes can differ from the ones used by 
broadcasters such as BBC, so make sure you use the correct ones. Otherwise the automatic scripts will not recognise them.
For example, Spain is ESP, not SPA, and Switzerland is SUI, not SWI. 
<br>
Because all players may not know each other, 
I'm also asking you to give your institution and nationality, which will be
listed on the web site. If you don't want them to be listed, just leave
those lines empty. I will also keep your email address to send you updates about this competition
and for the Euro 2024 and World Cup 2026 competition announcements, but it won't be displayed and I will not share
it with others. If you would like me to delete these personal details after the competition, please le me know by email.

<h2>History:</h2>
This competition was first run for the 2002 World Cup by
Rob Crittenden, Arttu Rajantie and Jochen Weller, who were postdocs at 
DAMTP in Cambridge at the time. Then the partipants were mainly from 
Cambridge, but during the years the competition has grown both in numbers 
and in geographical coverage. The past winners are:
