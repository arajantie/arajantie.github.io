<h2> The rules: </h1>
<ul>
<li>
The basic idea is to buy "shares" in teams. Every time a team
wins a match, it earns points.
These points are divided among the shareholders according to the
number of shares they own.</li>
<li>
You can buy <b>8 shares in total</b>. You can choose how you spread them between the teams, but you can buy <b>at most 3 shares in any one team</b>. The number of shares per team is not fixed; the better teams will earn more points, but those points are likely to be spread among more shares. You must decide on your shares before the kick-off of the first match, and it is not possible to change them after that.
</li>
<li>
The number of points a team gets by winning a match depends on the stage of
the tournament:
<ul>
<li>  1 for the group stage matches (and 0.5 for a draw)</li>
<li>  1 for qualifying to the playoff stage</li>
<li>  2 for the round of 16</li>
<li>  4 for the quarter finals</li>
<li>  8 for the semi finals</li>
<li>  16 for the final</li>
</ul>
<pre>
    the number of points you get= 
         (the number of points the team got) 
       * (the number of shares you own in the team)
       / (the total number of shares in the team)
</pre>
</li>
<li>
The winner is the player who has the most points after the tournament.
In case of a draw, the player who owns a bigger share in the winning team
wins (or if those are equal then the runner-up and so on.) 
</li>
<li>
No money will be involved: The winner's prize will be eternal glory.
In addition, the losers may feel a moral obligation to buy
the winner a beer or some alternative beverage should
an opportunity to this arise.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>History:</h2>
This competition was first run for the 2002 World Cup by
Rob Crittenden, Arttu Rajantie and Jochen Weller, who were postdocs at 
DAMTP in Cambridge at the time. Then the partipants were mainly from 
Cambridge, but during the years the competition has grown both in numbers 
and in geographical coverage. The past winners are:

<h2>Remarks:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
For the most popular teams, the number of shares is likely to be large and
the number of points per share therefore low. It may therefore be better
to try to pick undervalued teams rather than the overall winner.
</li>
<li>
It may not be advisable to buy many shares in a single unpopular
teams, because that makes the pay-off per share lower. For instance,
if you are the only shareholder, it does not make any difference whether
you bought one or sixteen shares.
</li>
</ul> -->

Here <tt>Cxx</tt> are the three-letter country codes of the teams
you want to buy shares in. There must be <b>eight</b> in total, and any one team can appear only at most <b>three</b> times.
Please use the official country codes, which are listed below and which are not all necessary what you think they would be. Make sure you follow these instructions carefully because otherwise your entry is invalid.
<p>
Because all players may not know each other, 
I'm also asking you to give your institution and nationality, which will be
shown on the web site. If you don't want them to be listed, you can leave
those lines empty. I will also keep your email address to send you updates about this competition and for the World Cup 2026 and Euro 2028 competition announcements, but it won't be displayed and I will not share it with others. If you would like me to delete these personal details after the competition, please let me know by email.
